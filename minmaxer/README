MINMAXER is a tool which computes several different TRIANGULATIONS IN
TWO DIMENSIONS. minmaxer also allows the visualization of the progress
of the algorithms on a silicon graphic workstation. for a more
detailed description of minmaxer read the file "minmaxer.bin/README".



directory structure (every directory contains a README file):

minmaxer.bin: executables for SUN-SPARC and SGI with sample input data.
source.triangulation: (undocumented) source files for triangulation algorithms.
source.minmaxer: (undocumented) source files for minmaxer.
sample: sample programs that show how to use and compile the
	triangulation algorithms.
